```{r}
library(lazytest)
```

The goal of lazytest is to save development time by helping you rerun only the tests that have failed during the last run.
It integrates tightly with the testthat package and provides the `lazytest_local()` function, a drop-in replacement for `testthat::test_local()`, that 

- memoizes which tests have failed;
- runs only those tests in subsequent runs.

If all active tests have succeeded, the entire test suite is run in a second pass.

## Usage

Call `lazytest_local()` instead of `testthat::test_local()` or `devtools::test()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lazytest::lazytest_local()
```

The package also provides RStudio add-ins that run the tests in a new terminal.
Unfortunately, the "Test package" command is hard-wired to `devtools::test()`, and there seems to be no way to customize it or hook into it.

## Example

Let's create a package with two boilerplate tests.

```{r}
withr::local_options(usethis.quiet = TRUE)

pkg_parent_dir <- withr::local_tempdir()
pkg_dir <- file.path(pkg_parent_dir, "tea")
usethis::create_package(pkg_dir)
usethis::with_project(path = pkg_dir, {
  usethis::use_testthat()
  usethis::use_test("blop")
  usethis::use_test("blip")
})

```

If we run the tests, they all pass.

```{r}
withr::with_dir(
  pkg_dir,
  lazytest::lazytest_local()
)
```

Now if we replace one of the tests with a failing test,

```{r}
brio::write_lines(
  text =  c(
    'test_that("blop() works", {',
    'expect_equal(2 * 2, 42)',
    '})'
  ),
  path = file.path(pkg_dir, "tests", "testthat", "test-blop.R")   
)

```

and then run the tests,

```{r, error=TRUE}
withr::with_dir(
  pkg_dir,
  lazytest::lazytest_local()
)
```

a file is created with the failing test name:

```{r}
brio::read_lines(file.path(pkg_dir, ".lazytest"))
```

Next time we run the tests, only this test will be run, until it is fixed at which point all tests are run again to check no failure has been introduced elsewhere.

```{r, error=TRUE}
withr::with_dir(
  pkg_dir,
  lazytest::lazytest_local()
)
```

## How does it work?

`testthat::test_local()` returns an object from which the tests that have failed can be retrieved.
`lazytest_local()` wraps this function.
If tests have failed, a file named `.lazytest` is written in the package directory.
In the next call, if `.lazytest` exists, it is consulted, and a suitable `filter` argument is constructed and passed to `testthat::test_local()`.

When all tests have passed and not all tests were run, a second call to `testthat::test_local()` is initiated, to make sure that no failures have been introduced in the meantime.


## Installation and optional setup

You can install the development version of lazytest from [cynkra R-universe](https://cynkra.r-universe.dev/):

``` r
install.packages('lazytest', repos = c('https://cynkra.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

Or from GitHub:

``` r
pak::pak("krlmlr/lazytest")
```

If you're using RStudio, it is a good idea to remap the shortcut for running tests (default: Ctrl + Shift + T / Cmd + Shift + T).
The add-in provides two commands:

- Run Lazy Tests in New Terminal (recommended mapping: Ctrl + Shift + T / Cmd + Shift + T)

- Reset And Run Lazy Tests in New Terminal (recommended mapping: Ctrl + T / Cmd + T)

This allows you to keep the workflows you're accustomed to and to benefit immediately.
